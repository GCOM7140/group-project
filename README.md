### Objectives

The goal of the group project is to give you an opportunity to apply the skills
you're learning in [R for Data Science][Grolemund and Wickham 2017] to the arena
of [customer analytics][Bradlow, Fader, Yyengar, and Bernman], such that you end
up turning consumer/customer data into [significant, actionable, interesting,
novel, and broad insights][Colquitt and George 2011] for [The Juice
Laundry][tjl] (TJL), a local Charlottesville business partnering with us for the
group project. The data sets we'll cover in class for this purpose include the
following:

* [thejuicelaundry] - an R data package with transaction information for all of
TJL's locations from October 11, 2016 to December 31, 2018.
* [Google Trends] - search interest data for topics relevant to The Juice
Laundry.

The more you engage in [this process of data science][Hadley 2017], the better
you will be at [generating, disseminating, and responding][Jaworski and Kohli
1993] to market intelligence. Improving your ability to perform these three core
activities will in turn allow you to help companies&mdash;especially those you
want to work for&mdash;achieve a market orientation and [optimize collective
value][Donaldson and Walsh 2015]. After all, optimizing collective value (i.e.,
prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a result,
customer analytics in the first place.

Your tasks are to select an area of the business that TJL should be
prioritizing, generate market intelligence in this regard, and develop an action
plan that logically flows from what you learn. In line with [Colquitt and George
(2011)][Colquitt and George 2011], you should strive to address a topic that:

* Takes on a grand challenge (i.e., has a compelling raison d'être)  
   + By aiming to solve a piece of a larger societal puzzle (e.g., encouraging
   healthier eating habits, making commerce more sustainable)
* Changes the conversation
   + By exploring the potential of a bold idea that could lead TJL in an
   unfamiliar, nascent, and radically different direction
* Catches and holds Mike and Sarah???s attention
   + By challenging their taken-for-granted assumptions or solving a mystery you
   uncover that has multiple plausible endings and cannot be guessed
* Casts a wide net
        + By covering the landscape of your topic adequately and, thus,
        considering multiple outcome variables and boundary conditions
* Offers insights for practice
        + By highlighting the (potential) effect of your proposed solution and
        developing ideas that Mike and Sarah can act on

### The Juice Laundry

The Juice Laundry (TJL) is a juice and smoothie bar with three locations, two in
Charlottesville, VA, and one in Washington, DC. Founded by University of
Virginia alumni Mike and Sarah Keenan, TJL's mission is "to inspire healthy,
organic, powerful change." In-store signage articulates Mike and Sarah???s value
proposition to customers as follows:

> The Juice Laundry was founded on the concept of keeping our bodies clean and
healthy, starting with what we put into them. Raw, organic fruits and veggies
are nature's medicine and the foundation of preventative health care. Whether
juiced, blended, or eaten whole, fresh produce is full of life-giving nutrients
and enzymes. We choose to use 100% organic ingredients, 100% of the time,
because the phrase 'organic whenever possible' is often highly misleading. If we
can't find something organic on a given day, it won't be on our menu. That's our
commitment to you, and to your health.

Elsewhere in TJL's locations, the brand's slogan "Clean Your Machine" is
displayed prominently, as are the brand's defining principles: "We are Raw. We
are Fresh. We are Clean. We are Organic. We are Curious. We are Passionate. We
are Transparent. We Leave a Gentle Footprint." Missing in stores, however, are
trash cans, as 100% of TJL???s packaging is either compostable or reusable.


### Deliverables

There are two key deliverables for the group project:

1. A report of no more than *15 pages*&mdash;stapled, two sided, and double spaced with one-inch margins and 12-point font, excluding references, tables, figures, and appendices (which have no page limit). I will use the [report guidelines](#report-guidelines) below to assess your report and give you developmental feedback. Submit your report both in hard copy form to my mailbox and electronically via GitHub no later than April 26 at 12:30 PM.

2. A group presentation of no more than *12 minutes*, followed by up to *eight minutes* of Q&A. [Invited guests][Dhakad et al. 2018], your peers, and I will use the [presentation guidelines](#presentation-guidelines) below to assess your presentation and give you developmental feedback. This [agenda][agenda] will guide when groups present. Add your *final* presentation title to the [agenda][agenda] no later than April 19 at 12:30 PM. Submit your slide deck electronically via GitHub no later than April 26 at 12:30 PM.

### Report Guidelines

Your report should advocate for strategic change to a focal company's marketing mix. Base your action plan on the shoulders of (i) a topic with an impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011]; (ii) a decision-making process with strong [principles][Dalio 2017]; (iii) data that are described [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012]; (iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017]; and (v) [stylish writing][Sword 2012].

After reading your report, I will use the following guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you develop a report worthy of an exemplary grade.

#### Decision-Making Principles (20%)
- Cogent reasoning explains why the major decision being considered has an impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011].  
- The long-term, detrimental implications of inaction for the focal company are argued concretely.  
- Alternative courses of action are identified in a balanced, convincing manner.  
- Decision criteria relevant to the major decision at hand are defined and ranked cogently.  
- The proposed decision is very well reasoned, because said decision criteria are used to evaluate the alternatives rigorously.

#### Data (20%)
- The [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] and definitions of the data and variables being analyzed to make decisions are described [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].  
- Convincing reasons explain why certain data are given priority over others (e.g., red herrings).  
- Data limitations are stated at appropriate times.

#### Method (20%)
- A breadth and depth of techniques covered in [R for Data Science][Grolemund and Wickham 2017] are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017].  
- A knowledgeable individual could [reproduce][Peng 2012] your findings with ease, because&mdash;in addition to your report&mdash;self-contained, executable code and the data being analyzed are accessible via GitHub.  
- Visualizations are used in ways that force the reader to notice [unexpected phenomena][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 3.3].  
- Hoofbeats are interpreted as signs of horses not [zebras][Sotos 2006].  
- Methodological limitations are stated at appropriate times.

#### Action Plan (20%)
- All relevant elements of the marketing mix are covered in detail.  
- What needs to be done (i.e., who, when, what, where, why, and how) is discussed expansively.  
- The overall recommendation being proposed is creative (i.e., novel and useful).  
- [SMART goals][Miller 2018] are set in order to establish expected results.<sup>1</sup>

#### Style \& Grammar (20%)
- The expectations Prof. Patterson set in Communication are all exceeded.<sup>2</sup>  
- Tables and figures are all formatted properly and [effectively][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 28.1].  
- Every sentence is grammatically correct, and all sentences flow together naturally.  
- The report is free of spelling errors.  
- Every reference is cited correctly.  
- The [*Journal of Marketing Research* Style Guide][JMR] and [Hadley's R Style Guide][Wickham 2014] are adhered to at all times.

<sup>1</sup> SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They may relate to consumers' attitudes, emotions, and actions, as well as to the triple bottom line (i.e., profits, people, and the planet).  
<sup>2</sup> Expectations set in Communication include, but are not limited to, the following: BLUF writing, SAS headings/tables/figures, and SEC plain English.

### Presentation Guidelines

Your presentation should be prepared as if it is being delivered to executives of your chosen company, and your goal is to persuade them to pursue the action plan you are advancing for their consideration.

After listening to your presentation, [invited guests][Dhakad et al. 2018], your peers, and I will use the following guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you deliver a presentation worthy of an exemplary grade.

- The group discussed the data they analyzed in a [simple, easy-to-understand way][Allen 2017].  
- The group built an argument with a breadth and depth of analyses that motivated me to accept their claims.  
- The group "edutained"" by [fusing scientific rigor with canny attention-grabbing][Allen 2017].  
- The group responded to questions and reservations [appropriately][Jolles 2013].  
- The group presented as a TEAM (i.e., contributions were comparable and complementary).  
- The group's slides were [self-explanatory][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 28.1], well referenced, and free of errors.
