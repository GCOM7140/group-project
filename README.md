# The Group Project
## Overview and Objectives
### General Overview
This group project will give you an opportunity to apply the skills you are
learning in [R for Data Science][Grolemund and Wickham 2017] and [Text Mining
With R][Silge and Robinson 2017] to the arenas of customer and text analytics,
such that you will end up turning numeric and text data into significant,
actionable, and interesting insights for [Meals on Wheels of
Charlottesville/Albemarle][cvillemeals] (C'ville Meals), a local nonprofit
organization that is partnering with us for the purposes of this group project.

The more you engage in [the process of data science][Hadley 2017], the better
you will be at [generating, disseminating, and responding][Jaworski and Kohli
1993] to market intelligence. Improving your ability to perform these three core
activities will in turn allow you to help companies&mdash;especially those you
want to work for&mdash;achieve a market orientation and optimize collective
value. After all, optimizing collective value (i.e., prosperity) is arguably why
society engages in commerce ([Donaldson and Walsh 2015][]) and, as a result,
customer and text analytics in the first place.

### Organization Overview
C'ville Meals strives to improve the health and support the independence and
dignity of our homebound neighbors. With an active volunteer force of over 400
drivers and four dedicated staff members, C'ville Meals serves around 4,500
meals to approximately 275 clients every month in the city of Charlottesville
and the county of Albemarle. More information on C'ville Meals is available at
www.cvillemeals.org.

### Project Scope
For this group project, C'ville Meals is offering us a lab of sorts, wherein you
can talk with its staff, including Executive Director Robin Wynn Goldstein;
analyze data; develop ideas; and, eventually, see the impact of your hard work
in our community.

The specific ask from Robin is for you to develop a month's worth of Instagram
content for C'ville Meals' Instagram account:
[@cvillemeals](https://www.instagram.com/cvillemeals/). Furthermore, Robin is
excited to hear themed ideas (i.e., ideas focused on a specific topic) and ideas
that stem from your analysis of donor behavior and Instagram data. Themes that
Robin put forward for your consideration include the following:

* Spring Appeal: We plan to focus on our new tagline "the hidden hungry" in our
spring appeal, which will go out in May 2022. Our goal is to raise $25k by the
end of the month with snail mail appeals and peer-to-peer campaigns that engage
volunteers. An Instagram campaign that complemented these marketing activities
and that increased the amount we raise in the month of May would be exciting to
see.
* Taste This!: In August and September of 2022, our focus will be on (a) driving
ticket sales for our annual fundraiser, Taste This!, and (b) highlighting event
sponsors, our venue partner, Pro Re Nata, and the band that will play. Our goals
for this event are to sell out and raise additional money through the silent
auction we organize.
* End-of-year appeal: In the months of November and December, we will look to
increase donations through snail mail and social media. However, we have not set
a target for how much we want to raise at the end of this year. Your analysis of
historical donations could help us set a target for this year. During the last
two months of the year, we also promote our Subaru Share the Love Event. 
* March for Meals: The entire month of March in 2023 could be spent on community
education (in conjunction with Meals on Wheels across the country) and culminate
in an series of posts during the last week of the month, which is Champions
week, where local celebrities and local/state/federal politicians will help
deliver meals to raise awareness for the needs of our homebound community.
* Volunteer Appreciation Month: we celebrate our volunteers every April, and we
are interested learning how we could best highlight individual volunteers
throughout the month of April 2023 while putting out calls for new volunteers.

Given the above, you should consider your objectives as twofold: (1) identify a
month or 30-day period in the May 2022 to April 2023 time frame and (2) develop
a concrete, comprehensive, and convincing Instagram campaign that logically
stems from [data-informed insights][Parker 2017/06/06].

### Data and Methods Advice
As you get started on this project, we encourage you to be divergent in your
thinking (see [Peng 2018][]). Begin *today* by conducting secondary research on
platforms such as [Business Source Complete], [Euromonitor], [Factiva],
[IBISWorld], [Statista], and other platforms (see the [Commerce LibGuide] for
options). Then, with a better understanding of the landscape that C'ville Meals
operates in, conduct primary research via relevant online sites, such as
[Facebook], [Instagram], and [Twitter].

In class, we will analyze data available in the {cvillemeals} R package, which
includes C'ville Meals' donation records, as well as information about a related
set of Instagram accounts and the engagement they have generated. Get to know
this data as soon as you can to increase the likelihood that your Instagram
campaign will rest on a strong foundation of data-informed insights.

It will also be important for you to describe the [provenance][Polich and
Whitenack 2017] of your data parsimoniously and to define the variables you
analyze [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].

   __Pro tip__: Be [radically open minded]&mdash;and [productively
   stupid][Schwartz 2008]&mdash;from the get go and strive not to let
   confirmation bias contaminate your findings as you make sense of the
   landscape that C'ville Meals operates in ([Gallo 2017][]).

   __Pro tip__: Organize your observations into tidy data sets, such as those
   discussed in [Chapter 12][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 12] of R for Data
   Science so you can summarize them statistically and visually. This process
   will add rigor to your analysis and the insights you generate.

Finally, be sure to apply the methods you learn in Customer Analytics and Big
Data & Text Analytics effectively. You will get separate grades for each course,
so it is imperative that you demonstrate proper uses of methods being covered in
both courses. There are no firm requirements for the number of techniques you
need to perform as part of your analysis; however, we encourage you to generate
recommendations from the analysis of numeric data, text data, and some
combination of both. As such, we strongly encourage you to identify and act on
opportunities to incorporate the results of text analyses into models/procedures
that utilize numeric customer data.

## Deliverables
There are a total of three key deliverables for the group project, a status
check, a report, and a presentation:

### Status Check
A two page memo outlining a promising idea for your Instagram
campaign and preliminary analyses (based on secondary and primary data) that
could serve as the foundation for your proposed path forward. This memo
should offer a high-level description of how you plan to create a data-informed
Instagram campaign. What month or 30-day period in the May 2022 to April 2023
time frame would you focus on? Which variables and methods do you plan to
leverage to uncover insights, and how might these insights come to life in your
Instagram campaign? No grade will be assigned to this memo. However, it does
offer a valuable opportunity for you to get feedback from us on both the scope
of your proposed project as well as the analytical strategy you are proposing to
implement. Submit this memo via Blackboard no later than 11:59 pm on April 5.

### Final Submissions
3. A report of no more than 25 pages, 12-point font, double-spaced (excluding
references, exhibits, and appendices). We will use the [report
guidelines](#report-guidelines) below to assess your report and give you
developmental feedback. Submit your report along with any scripts and data you
used to perform your analyses via Blackboard no later than 5:00 pm on April 24.

4. A presentation of no more than 20 minutes, plus up to 10 minutes of Q&A. An
agenda will guide when groups present. Your peers and your professors will use
the [presentation guidelines](#presentation-guidelines) below to assess your
presentation and give you developmental feedback. Submit your slide deck via
Blackboard no later than 5:00 pm on April 24.

## Grading Breakdown

Your final grade for the project will be determined based on both your report
and presentation. Certain elements of this grade will be consistent across both
courses (Style & Grammar and Presentation Skills) while others may diverge. Your
professors will independently review and evaluate your report and presentation,
giving special attention to the portions of your analysis that relate to the
content covered in their courses. They will share their evaluations with each
other and discuss discrepancies; hence, it is possible that groups may receive
different grades for each class. While the grading categories will be the same
for both courses, group performance in some categories may be stronger for
analyses aligning with one course as compared to the other.

The following table summarizes the breakdown of how final project grades will be
determined:

Grading Component          | Percentage of Total Grade|
---------------------------|:------------------------:|
Decision-making principles |	15%                     |
Data                       |	15%                     |
Methods                    |	25%                     |
Action plan	               |  20%                     |
Report style & grammar     |	10%                     |
Presentation skills        |	15%                     |

## Status Check Guidelines

This memo should outline a promising path forward based on your initial
exploration of the data.  Specifically, it should describe:

1. Your idea for a month-long Instagram campaign. 
2. The data (i.e., data sets, rows, and columns) that you plan to incorporate in
your analyses.
3. Analytical procedures that you believe are appropriate for developing
insights and recommendations from the data you plan on analyzing.

There is no one "right" way to organize this proposal; however, you should make
sure to outline what you plan to do&mdash;between the date this proposal is due
and the week you present to Robin&mdash;very carefully. While your memo must be
concise, it should illustrate that your group has thought critically, and in a
divergent manner, about C'ville Meals' organization. Your idea(s) should have
the potential to become a concrete, comprehensive, and convincing Instagram
campaign that logically stems from data-informed insights.

Regarding the second requirement for this memo, we want to see that you have
more than a surface-level understanding of the {cvillemeals} data package, which
you are being trained to analyze. At a minimum, you should have already thought
about and experimented with {dplyr} statements to get these data sets into the
forms you need them in. This is why it is important to describe not only your
analysis but also the data you intend to use. Although not required, it will be
exemplary if you describe any new-to-the-world tidy datasets that you have
compiled or plan to compile. For example, you could supplement the `post` table
in the {cvillemeals} package with comparable data for another account that has
successfully implemented a relevant month-long Instagram campaign.

For the third requirement, two questions we want to see you convey answers to
include: How do you plan on analyzing these data sets (i.e., with what
methods?), and what artifacts (e.g., graphics and model estimates) do you plan
on producing?

Again, there is no grade associated with this status check; however, this is an
opportunity to gain valuable feedback on the approach you have devised to
satisfy the project requirements. Your professors will review your memo in
detail and provide feedback meant to guide you toward a high-quality final
report and presentation. If appropriate, a meeting may be scheduled to discuss
your memo in more detail and ensure that your group is on a path toward success.

## Report Guidelines

Your report should advocate for an Instagram campaign that C'ville Meals could
put into place in the Mayy 2022 to April 2023 time frame. Base your
recommendation on (i) a decision-making process with strong [principles][Dalio
2017]; (iii) data that are described [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang
and Shaw 2012]; (iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that are applied
[accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017]; and (v) [stylish
writing][Sword 2012].

Your report should contain the following sections: (1) title page, (2) executive
summary, (3) main body, (4) references, (5) exhibits, and, potentially, (6)
appendices. Before you submit your final document, make sure it is as error free
as possible, clearly communicated, and professionally designed&mdash;i.e.,
client-ready. Note: Producing client-ready business documents is time consuming.
Plan early and review your progress often to make sure that you are working
collaboratively to design, create, and deliver a client-ready document.

There is no one "right" way to organize the main body of the report; however,
you should think carefully about what your audience (in this case, Robin Wynn
Goldstein) already knows and prioritize discussing original analysis that you
conducted over general statements about C'ville Meals, for example.

After reading your report, we will use the following guidelines to assess your
work and provide you with developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines
will help you develop a report worthy of an exemplary grade.

### Decision-Making Principles (15%)
* Cogent reasoning explains why the Instagram campaign you are recommending is
likely to succeed.
* Long-term, detrimental implications of not implementing your Instagram
campaign for C'ville Meals are argued concretely.
* The proposed course of action is very well reasoned.
* Hoofbeats are interpreted as signs of horses not [zebras][Sotos 2006].  
* The recommended Instagram campaign stems from analytical results, which
provides legitimacy to it.

### Data (15%)
* The [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] and definitions of the data and
variables being analyzed to make decisions are described [clearly, completely,
and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].
* Convincing reasons explain why certain data are given priority (over others).
* An appropriate variety of data is included in the analysis to inform
decision-making from multiple angles using a mixture of numeric and text data.
* Statements about data limitations are made at appropriate times.

### Methods (25%)
* A breadth and depth of techniques covered in [R for Data Science][Grolemund
and Wickham 2017] and [Text Mining With R][Silge and Robinson 2017] are applied 
[accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017].
* The techniques being performed complement one another and create synergies
that offer deeper insights than the individual analyses would offer
independently.
* A knowledgeable individual could [reproduce][Peng 2011] the report's findings
with ease, because the group's submission provides access to not only the
report, but also self-contained, executable code and the data being analyzed.
* Visualizations are used in ways that force the reader to notice [unexpected
phenomena][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 3.3].
* Statements about methodological limitations are made at appropriate times.

### Action Plan (20%)
* All relevant elements of your Instagram campaign are covered in detail.  
* What should be posted (i.e., picture, caption, location, tags) and when it
should be posted are outlined fully.
* The overall recommendation being proposed is creative (i.e., novel and
useful).
* Goals related to follower engagement and donations are set in [specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound][Miller 2018] ways in order to
establish expected results.

### Style \& Grammar (10%)
* The expectations set in Communication&mdash;which include, but are not limited
to, BLUF writing, SAS headings/tables/figures, and SEC plain English&mdash;are
met or exceeded at all times.
* Tables and figures are all formatted properly and [effectively][Grolemund and
Wickham 2017, 28.1].
* Appendices are used appropriately and as needed.
* Every sentence is grammatically correct, and all sentences flow together
naturally.
* The report is free of spelling errors.  
* All references, including endnotes and reference list entries, adhere to the
[HBS Citation Guidelines][].
* The [Tidyverse Style Guide][] is adhered to at all times with respect to the
report's [files][style files], [syntax][style syntax], and [pipes][style pipes].

## Presentation Guidelines
Your group should prepare your presentation as you would if you were presenting
to Robin in "the real world," with the goal of persuading her to actually
implement the Instagram campaign you are advancing. Ask for the highest
realistic level of commitment you can at the end of your presentation, and try
your best to receive her approval during the Q&A period.

After listening to your presentation, invited guests, your peers, and your
professors will use the following guidelines to assess it and give you
developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you deliver a
presentation, which constitutes one-third of the group project grade, that is
worthy of an exemplary grade.

* The group built a case for the Instagram campaign they proposed with a breadth
and depth of well-principled analyses that motivated me to accept their claims.
* The group discussed the data they analyzed in a [simple, easy-to-understand
way][Allen 2017].
* The group was captivating, edutaining, and eye-catching, a "[fusion of
scientific rigor with canny attention-grabbing][Allen 2017]."
* The group presented as a team (i.e., their contributions were comparable and
complementary).
* The group's slides were [self-explanatory][Grolemund and Wickham 2017,
28.1], well referenced, and free of errors.
* The group responded to questions and reservations [appropriately][Jolles
2013].
