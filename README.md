# The Group Project: Objectives and Deliverables

The goal of the group project is to give you an opportunity to apply the skills you're learning in [**R for Data Science**][R4DS] to the arena of [**customer analytics**][Wharton class], such that you end up turning consumer/customer data into [**significant, novel, interesting, broad, and actionable insights**][The anatomy of a good topic] for a company of your group's interest. The data sets we will cover in class for this purpose include the following:

[Wharton class]: https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-customer-analytics
[The anatomy of a good topic]: https://aom.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/AMJ/FTE-TopicChoice.pdf

* [**comScore**][] web traffic data for DTC and other e-commerce sites relevant to your company
* [**Euromonitor Passport**][] brand share data for industries relevant to your company
* [**Google Trends**][] search interest data for topics relevant to your company

The more you engage in [**this process of data science**][Hadley 2017], the better you will be at [**generating, disseminating, and responding to market intelligence**][Kohli and Jaworski 1993]. Improving your ability to perform these three core activities will in turn allow you to help companies—especially the ones you want to work for—achieve a market orientation, commercial success, and [**optimized collective value**][Donaldson and Walsh 2015]. Recall that optimizing collective value (or prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a result, customer analytics in the first place.

There are two key deliverables for the group project (due on April 26 at 12:30 PM):

1. A report of no more than *15 pages*—stapled, two sided, and double spaced with one-inch margins and 12-point font, excluding references, tables, figures, and appendices (which have no page limit)—per group. I will use this rubric to assess and provide you developmental feedback on your report. Your report must also be submitted electronically according to the reproducibility criteria of the rubric.

2. A group presentation of no more than *12 minutes*, followed by up to *eight minutes* of Q&A. Invited guests, your peers, and I will use this rubric to assess and provide you with developmental feedback on your presentation. This [agenda][] will guide the order of the group presentations. Be sure to add your group's *final* presentation title to it no later than April 19 at 12:30 PM.
