### Objectives

The goal of this group project is to give you an opportunity to apply the skills
you're learning in [R for Data Science][Grolemund and Wickham 2017] to the arena
of [customer analytics][Bradlow, Fader, Yyengar, and Bernman], such that you end
up turning consumer/customer data into [significant, actionable, interesting,
novel, and broad insights][Colquitt and George 2011] for [The Juice
Laundry][tjl] (TJL), a local Charlottesville business that's partnering with us
for the purposes this group project. The data sets we'll cover in class for this
purpose include the following:

* [thejuicelaundry] - an R data package with transaction information for all of
TJL's locations from October 11, 2016 to December 31, 2018.
* [Google Trends] - search interest data for topics relevant to The Juice
Laundry.

The more you engage in [this process of data science][Hadley 2017], the better
you'll be at [generating, disseminating, and responding][Jaworski and Kohli
1993] to market intelligence. Improving your ability to perform these three core
activities will in turn allow you to help companies&mdash;especially those you
want to work for&mdash;achieve a market orientation and [optimize collective
value][Donaldson and Walsh 2015]. After all, optimizing collective value (i.e.,
prosperity) is arguably why society engages in commerce and, as a result,
customer analytics in the first place.

### The Juice Laundry

TJL is an organic juice and smoothie bar with three locations, two in
Charlottesville, VA, and one in Washington, DC. Founded by UVa alumni Mike and
Sarah Keenan, TJL's mission is "to inspire healthy, organic, powerful change."
In-store signage articulates Mike and Sarah's value proposition to customers as
follows:

> The Juice Laundry was founded on the concept of keeping our bodies clean and
healthy, starting with what we put into them. Raw, organic fruits and veggies
are nature's medicine and the foundation of preventative health care. Whether
juiced, blended, or eaten whole, fresh produce is full of life-giving nutrients
and enzymes. We choose to use 100% organic ingredients, 100% of the time,
because the phrase 'organic whenever possible' is often highly misleading. If we
can't find something organic on a given day, it won't be on our menu. That's our
commitment to you, and to your health.

Elsewhere in TJL's locations, the brand's slogan "Clean Your Machine" is
displayed prominently, as are the brand's defining principles: "We are Raw. We
are Fresh. We are Clean. We are Organic. We are Curious. We are Passionate. We
are Transparent. We Leave a Gentle Footprint." Missing in stores, however, are
trash cans, as 100% of TJL's packaging is either compostable or reusable.

For this group project, TJL offers a lab of sorts, somewhere you can talk with
business owners, employees, and customers; develop and test ideas; analyze data;
and, eventually, see the impact of your hard work right in our backyard on the
Corner.

### Tasks
Your tasks are to identify an area of the business that's worth looking into;
make a data-informed and principled decision on what direction TJL should go in;
and develop a convincing action plan that logically flows from what you learn.

#### Topic Identification
In line with [Colquitt and George (2011)][Colquitt and George 2011], you should
strive to identify and address a topic that:

* __Takes on a grand challenge__ (i.e., has a compelling raison d'être)
   + By aiming to solve a piece of a larger societal puzzle and, thus, having a
   compelling purpose (e.g., encouraging healthier eating habits, making
   commerce more sustainable).
* __Changes the conversation__
   + By exploring the potential of a bold idea that could lead TJL in an
   unfamiliar, nascent, and radically different direction.
* __Catches and holds Mike and Sarah's attention__
   + By challenging their taken-for-granted assumptions and solving a mystery
   you uncover that has multiple plausible endings and cannot be guessed.
* __Casts a wide net__
   + By covering the landscape of your topic adequately and, thus, considering a
   multitude of outcome variables, boundary conditions, and explanations.
* __Offers insights for practice__
   + By estimating the potential effect of a new and important practice and
   conveying findings that Mike and Sarah will be able to act on in the near
   term.

As is reflected in [Table 1], Mike and Sarah are interested in topics that focus
on grand challenges, promise to offer actionable insights, and peak their
curiosity. With these priorities in mind, you should be able to exercise your
marketing skills and help TJL further achieve a market orientation.

While developing a list of potential topics to focus on, I encourage you to be
divergent in your thinking ([Peng 2018][]). Conduct extensive research on
Elevate, Euromonitor, Factiva, Google Trends, Instagram, Yelp, etc. This
research, which can also occur in TJL's and its competitors' storefronts, will
uncover challenges that TJL is facing (e.g., some consumers perceive that TJL
offers low [value][Zeithaml 1988]) and a number of promising alternatives that
TJL could consider implementing to address these challenges (e.g., launching an
Instagram campaign focused on educating their followers about the true cost of
food).

   __Pro tip__: Be radically open minded&mdash;and [productively
   stupid][Schwartz 2008]&mdash;during this step and strive not to let
   confirmation bias contaminate your findings as you make sense of the market
   ([Gallo 2017][]).

   __Pro tip__: Organize your observations into tidy datasets, such as those
   discussed in [Chapter 12][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 12] of R for Data
   Science so you can summarize them statistically and visually. This process
   will add rigor to your analysis/insights.

Sort the challenges stemming from your research into buckets full of
alternatives. Then, use the prioritization framework that [Colquitt and George
(2011)][Colquitt and George 2011] offer to select three challenges (i.e.,
"topics") that you believe are most worth looking into and highlight these in
Table 1. From here, you will arrive at the topic that you will do further
research and reporting on for your group project report and presentation.

   __Pro tip__: Explain your topics clearly in Table 1, so that Mike and Sarah
   will be able to grasp: (a) the challenges your topics are focused on
   overcoming and (b) the alternatives your research has led you to consider.

### Deliverables

There are two key deliverables for the group project:

1. A report of no more than *15 pages*&mdash;stapled, two sided, and double spaced with one-inch margins and 12-point font, excluding references, tables, figures, and appendices (which have no page limit). I will use the [report guidelines](#report-guidelines) below to assess your report and give you developmental feedback. Submit your report both in hard copy form to my mailbox and electronically via GitHub no later than April 26 at 12:30 PM.

2. A group presentation of no more than *12 minutes*, followed by up to *eight minutes* of Q&A. [Invited guests][Dhakad et al. 2018], your peers, and I will use the [presentation guidelines](#presentation-guidelines) below to assess your presentation and give you developmental feedback. This [agenda][agenda] will guide when groups present. Add your *final* presentation title to the [agenda][agenda] no later than April 19 at 12:30 PM. Submit your slide deck electronically via GitHub no later than April 26 at 12:30 PM.

### Report Guidelines

Your report should advocate for strategic change to a focal company's marketing mix. Base your action plan on the shoulders of (i) a topic with an impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011]; (ii) a decision-making process with strong [principles][Dalio 2017]; (iii) data that are described [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012]; (iv) a breadth and depth of analyses that are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017]; and (v) [stylish writing][Sword 2012].

After reading your report, I will use the following guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you develop a report worthy of an exemplary grade.

#### Decision-Making Principles (20%)
- Cogent reasoning explains why the major decision being considered has an
impressive [anatomy][Colquitt and George 2011].
- The long-term, detrimental implications of inaction for the focal company are
argued concretely.
- Alternative courses of action are identified in a balanced, convincing manner.
- Decision criteria relevant to the major decision at hand are defined and
ranked cogently.
- The proposed decision is very well reasoned, because said decision criteria
are used to evaluate the alternatives rigorously.

#### Data (20%)
- The [provenance][Polich and Whitenack 2017] and definitions of the data and variables being analyzed to make decisions are described [clearly, completely, and credibly][Zhang and Shaw 2012].  
- Convincing reasons explain why certain data are given priority over others (e.g., red herrings).  
- Data limitations are stated at appropriate times.

#### Method (20%)
- A breadth and depth of techniques covered in [R for Data Science][Grolemund and Wickham 2017] are applied [accurately, collaboratively, and reproducibly][Parker 2017].  
- A knowledgeable individual could [reproduce][Peng 2012] your findings with ease, because&mdash;in addition to your report&mdash;self-contained, executable code and the data being analyzed are accessible via GitHub.  
- Visualizations are used in ways that force the reader to notice [unexpected phenomena][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 3.3].  
- Hoofbeats are interpreted as signs of horses not [zebras][Sotos 2006].  
- Methodological limitations are stated at appropriate times.

#### Action Plan (20%)
- All relevant elements of the marketing mix are covered in detail.  
- What needs to be done (i.e., who, when, what, where, why, and how) is discussed expansively.  
- The overall recommendation being proposed is creative (i.e., novel and useful).  
- [SMART goals][Miller 2018] are set in order to establish expected results.<sup>1</sup>

#### Style \& Grammar (20%)
- The expectations Prof. Patterson set in Communication are all exceeded.<sup>2</sup>  
- Tables and figures are all formatted properly and [effectively][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 28.1].  
- Every sentence is grammatically correct, and all sentences flow together naturally.  
- The report is free of spelling errors.  
- Every reference is cited correctly.  
- The [*Journal of Marketing Research* Style Guide][JMR] and [Hadley's R Style Guide][Wickham 2014] are adhered to at all times.

<sup>1</sup> SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They may relate to consumers' attitudes, emotions, and actions, as well as to the triple bottom line (i.e., profits, people, and the planet).  
<sup>2</sup> Expectations set in Communication include, but are not limited to, the following: BLUF writing, SAS headings/tables/figures, and SEC plain English.

### Presentation Guidelines

Your presentation should be prepared as if it is being delivered to executives of your chosen company, and your goal is to persuade them to pursue the action plan you are advancing for their consideration.

After listening to your presentation, [invited guests][Dhakad et al. 2018], your peers, and I will use the following guidelines to assess it and give you developmental feedback. Internalizing these guidelines will help you deliver a presentation worthy of an exemplary grade.

- The group discussed the data they analyzed in a [simple, easy-to-understand way][Allen 2017].  
- The group built an argument with a breadth and depth of analyses that motivated me to accept their claims.  
- The group "edutained"" by [fusing scientific rigor with canny attention-grabbing][Allen 2017].  
- The group responded to questions and reservations [appropriately][Jolles 2013].  
- The group presented as a TEAM (i.e., contributions were comparable and complementary).  
- The group's slides were [self-explanatory][Grolemund and Wickham 2017, 28.1], well referenced, and free of errors.
